## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist, AI enthusiast and former astrophysicist ðŸ”­ mainly building pipelines for image processing.

If you would like to collaborate on a project, need some data analysed or simply want to ask me about black holes, I am available for a coffee and a chat online or in Berlin (Germany).
